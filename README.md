ProtonVPN-GUI - client for ProtonVPN
--
**Dependencies:** openvpn unzip systemd

Download `*.zip` archive with configuration files `*.ovpn` (Android/Router, UDP/TCP) from your personal account, upload to the client and connect. Starting from `v1.1`, you can download `*.zip` archives files containing `*.ovpn` configurations of other VPN providers, for example `ZoogVPN`. Of course, the `Name` and `Password` will be different.

**Note:** Don't forget to open the iptables ports required for configurations. Made and tested in Mageia Linux-8/9.
